## Angular App Folder Structure

In a newly created Angular project, the `app` folder contains the core building blocks of your application. Here's a brief explanation of the three main files (excluding the HTML and CSS files) and how they work together:

1. **app.component.ts**: This file contains the code for the root component, `AppComponent`. It's the main "actor" of your app, responsible for controlling the user interface and orchestrating interactions between different parts of the app. The root component is the starting point for your application, and Angular uses it to bootstrap and launch your app.

2. **app.module.ts**: This file contains the code for the root NgModule, `AppModule`. Think of it as the blueprint for your application, organizing and structuring your app's building blocks (components, services, and other NgModules). The `AppModule` specifies which components, services, and other modules should be included in your app, and how they should work together. It also tells Angular which component (usually `AppComponent`) should be used as the starting point for bootstrapping the application.

3. **app-routing.module.ts** (optional): This file is created if you opted to include Angular routing when creating your project. It contains the code for setting up your app's navigation using the Angular Router. The RouterModule defines the routes (URL paths) and their corresponding components, allowing users to navigate through different parts of your app.

These three files work together as follows:

- `app.module.ts` imports `AppComponent` (from `app.component.ts`) and other necessary modules, like `BrowserModule` and `FormsModule`, and declares them in the `@NgModule` decorator. This sets up the structure of your application and tells Angular how to assemble it.
- If your app has routing, `app.module.ts` also imports `AppRoutingModule` (from `app-routing.module.ts`) and includes it in the `imports` array. This enables Angular to handle navigation and route changes in your app.
- When you run your app, Angular uses the information provided in `app.module.ts` to bootstrap the application, starting with the `AppComponent`.

In summary, the `app.component.ts`, `app.module.ts`, and `app-routing.module.ts` files work together to define the structure, main component, and navigation of your Angular application, making it easier for Angular to understand how to build and run your app.
